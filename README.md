<h1 align="center"> Conecte Estudo: Plataforma Web para Aux√≠lio no Ensino √† Dist√¢ncia </h1>

[Conecte Estudo](https://github.com/igor-rufino/webapp-ead) is a web application to aid distance learning, which includes a virtual agenda for the user.
For the student, it is a place where he can control his schedule, view his tasks and/or insert a new one, thinking about the practicality and routines to control and help his tasks.
For the teacher, it is a place where he can set up his classes, create tasks, execute teaching plans and class materials, as well as being able to control his own schedule and create activities for himself.

This project contains the REST API, developed using the Django framework, to connect the web application, developed in React, to the MongoDB database.

<h5>Make tables migrations to database: </h5>

### Creating a database on MongoDB<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/pt-br/products/compass"> Compass </a>:
<h5>You can create local variables like DB_USERNAME and DB_PASSWORD or just put the user in the URL to make the connection: </h5>
<h5> Note: we have a constant.py file with DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD and DJANGO_Key, you should create the same and put your own user and key. </h5>
<h5> On Settings.py you just import constant and use it. </h5>
